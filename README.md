# Ray Tracer

This is my first exploration into ray tracing. I am using The Cherno's ray tracing series and the 'Ray Tracing in One Weekend' book series by Peter Shirley, Trevor D Black, and Steve Hollasch as guidance and inspiration for this project. I am using Walnut, which is a barebones application framework that allows me to use real-time Vulkan rendering with a pre-built UI. Through this project, I hope to learn a lot about ray tracing and continue my exploration of graphics programming.
